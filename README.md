## üîç How It Works

### Context-Aware Translation
Booklator processes documents intelligently:

1. **Document Summary**: First generates a comprehensive summary of the entire document
2. **Chunked Processing**: Breaks the document into chunks of 10 paragraphs
3. **Context Windows**: For each chunk, includes:
   - 3 paragraphs before (for context)
   - The current 10 paragraphs
   - 3 paragraphs after (for context)
4. **Maintained Structure**: Preserves paragraph numbering and formatting

### Translation Quality
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model for high-quality translations
- Context windows ensure consistency across chunks
- Document summary provides overall context
- Custom prompts allow for specific translation requirements
